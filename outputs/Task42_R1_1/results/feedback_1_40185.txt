**Your Proficiency Level:** Developing

**What You Did Well:**
The student demonstrated sound structure despite missing some components.

**What Needs Attention:**
- Missing Concepts: Cold Water, Room Temperature Water, Hot Water, Water Particles, Dye Particles, Motion in Cold Water, Motion in Room Temperature Water, Motion in Hot Water, Temperature Effect on Motion
- Missing Relationships: connections not shown in sketch.
- Extra Concepts: Cold Water, Room Temperature Water, Hot Water, Water Particles, Motion in Cold Water, Motion in Room Temperature Water, Motion in Hot Water, Temperature Effect on Motion
- Depth Conflicts: Some concepts are not represented at the correct Bloom level.

**Co-Creation Guidance (Next Sketch Revisions):**
- Cold Water (Remember): Illustrate slow particle movement with short arrows.
- Room Temperature Water (Remember): Illustrate moderate particle movement with medium arrows.
- Hot Water (Remember): Illustrate fast particle movement with long arrows.
- Water Particles (Understand): Use neutral symbols and labels to represent water molecules.
- Dye Particles (Understand): Use colored symbols or specific labels for dye molecules.
- Motion in Cold Water (Apply): Use shorter arrows indicating slower motion.
- Motion in Room Temperature Water (Apply): Use medium arrows for moderate motion.
- Motion in Hot Water (Apply): Use long arrows for fast motion.
- Temperature Effect on Motion (Analyze): Show increased arrow length as temperature increases to indicate faster movement.
